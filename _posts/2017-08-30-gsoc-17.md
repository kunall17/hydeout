Brief report of my work in GSOC 2017

<!--more-->

# Google summer of code '17: Report

### Introduction

I worked on the react native framework, to enhance the cross platform group chat application for the organization **Zulip**.

I have been contributing to Zulip since my [last GSOC](./gsoc16) and it has been a great experience so far, thanks to the Zulip Organization for selecting me again.

In this course of 3 months I have done a lot of changes, implemented new features, fixed many crucial bugs, worked on not only RN but also on several other things.

###### _(Details on the above listed)_


##### Push notifications for android & ios

Used the wix/react-native-notifications for the ios & android notifications

###### Android

Initial implementation was

Then

[Grouped notifications into one and show the notifications as a list](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/734)  
[Initial implementation of android GCM push notifications](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/637)  
[Don't show message's count if only 1 message in the android notifications](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/802)  
[Use big view styles for 1 conversation](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/755)  


###### iOS

[Implementation of ios push notifications](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/746)  
[Added log statement and enabled background modes for ios notifications](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/1054)  


##### End to end integration test's using appium & detox

Initially I implemented appium, but the test's were flaky even after good writeup (even after getting it reviewed by experienced people)
Hence we decided to move on to detox which is a newer library built specifically for react native and its not flaky


[Add integration testing using appium for the iOS](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/602)  
[Replace appium with detox](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/825)  


##### Rework on the compose box design

Added a topic field to the compose box, by this now its possible to write a new topic in the stream narrow

[Hide mode changer as there is only one compose option: compose text](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/694)  
[Hide other icons in the ComposeOptions](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/689)  

[New compose box design](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/561)  

Similarly, implemented this for the private narrow as well
Unfortunately this PR didn't got through as we decided it's not the best UX to send messages to other people without narrowing to their conversation.

[New compose box design for private messages](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/678)  

[Display topic input only in stream narrow](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/945)  


##### Menu for the long press of message

This added to show menu on long press of a message and have features like reply, narrow etc.

[Show action sheet on long press of header](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/801)  

##### Editing message made possible

This added an imperative feature of editing a sent message, and was long due for the project.

[Implemented editing message](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/402)

##### Implemented prettier (code formatting)

One of most important part of my contribution, was this.
Prettier added a code styling guide and increased the code readability of the project.


[Renable prettier and fix all issues related to it](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/859)  was a massive PR to fix all the non-formatted code, and now the code styling of the project is much better

[Implement prettier for the project](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/850)  


##### Hooked up detox E2E & the prettier formatting check

This took a lot of time to use the UI testing checking automatically in the travis CI
Now the CI does a release build from scratch and use the generated file to run a end to end test, runs without any flakiness

Currently there aren't many test running as we need a dev server for the main screen testing

Prettier check test's if the code in the branch is formatted according the prettier specified format

[Added detox smoke test's in the travis CI](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/915)  
[Use prettier-check to check if all files are formatted with prettier](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/910)  


##### Markdown parser (converts markdown to html for messages)

This converts the markdown to the html which now helps locally echoing the sent message and previewing the written markdown in the Full Screen Editor.

[Implement markdown parser to convert markdown to html](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/949)  

##### Several changes in the settings screen


[Separate language to another screen in settings screen](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/944)  
[Add online notification switch to settings](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/828)

[Fetch updates for notification and display settings](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/754)  

##### Use parser to locally echo the message sent

Uses parser to convert

##### Implemented the outbox functionallity

[Implement reducers and actions for outbox and use it in ComposeBox](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/977)  
[Use result of post request for sending message](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/1079)

[Use outbox messages to render messages to the chat screen](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/1014)  

##### Message auto saved as drafts

[Implement drafts screen](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/1019)  

##### Full screen markdown editor

This is a full screen markdown editor which would be really helpful for writing long big formatted message

**Glimpse of the editor**

[I also extracted this out in a library ](https://github.com/kunall17/react-native-markdown-editor)

[Full screen markdown editor](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/882)  

##### Implemented muting of topics/streams

This added an option to mute/unmute topics/streams
